PetStore-OOP-Java
Hi, This is a simple Java project created for CS210 at Bellevue College to demonstrate OOP concepts. It includes classes for different pets (Rabbit, Betta Fish) and a PetStore main class that manages them.

Project Overview

In this assignment, I extended the original Pet program by creating **two new pet subclasses**:
- Rabbit    : includes a 'coatColor' field  
- Betta_fish: includes a unique 'speak()' method  

The main program ('PetStore.java') was modified to:
- Allow the user to create different types of pets ( New two types of pet: **Rabbit, Betta Fish**; Original two types of pet: Cat, Dog)
- Store all pet objects in an ArrayList<Pet>
- Display each pet’s description and its speak() message using polymorphism

What I Learned
-Design a class hierarchy with inheritance and polymorphism.
-Override methods
